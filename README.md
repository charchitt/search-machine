# search-machine

This is my maiden project on github. 
This script will give you list of VULNERABLE VULNHUB machines according to your need in a plain simple list format. 

I have included limited no. of query strings. You can modify the script by adding yours too. 

If you see any amendments to be made, kindly ping me. Constructive criticism is always welcomed on this side. 
Hope this simplifies your work of finding the machines. 

HAPPY HACKING, FELLAS!
